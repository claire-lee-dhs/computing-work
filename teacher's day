Dear Ms Low,

You always tell us no arc no mark, y=mx+c, one fraction on the left & one fraction on the right.
To you, evrything is also a hot favourite, but I know that you are right. 
Taking down notes is all that you care about.
You can never remember our names, calling us ah girl and ah boy. 
You always say that Dunamnians would become future MPs, but unfortunately we won't. 
But I know you do it for our good, making us work hard.
