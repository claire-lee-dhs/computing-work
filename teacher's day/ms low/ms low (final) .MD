#MS LOW

Dear Ms Low,

You always tell us no arc no mark, that taking notes would help. 
You say that everything is hot favourite, that all questions are good. 
I seem to think your favourite line is: "Dunmanians would become future MPs.", you say that all the time. 
As much as I wish it were true, I know that it is not. You are always nagging at us, telling us the same thing. 
As much as I hate all you nagging, I know that you are right. So right now from the bottom of heart, I wish you a happy teachers' day.
